			<h1>Pride and Prejudice</h1>
			<div class="story-body">
				<p>More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt
					all
					the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to
					prevent
					its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers.
					How it
					could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like
					wilful
					ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries
					and
					an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.
					He
					never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but
					it
					struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected
					questions--about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of
					Mr.
					and Mrs. Collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding
					the
					house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too.
					His
					words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he
					meant
					anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little,
					and
					she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.</p>

				<p>She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane’s last letter, and dwelling on some passages
					which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr.
					Darcy,
					she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately
					and
					forcing a smile, she said:</p>

				<p>“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”</p>

				<p>“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally do every year, and intend to
					close
					it with a call at the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?”</p>

				<p>“No, I should have turned in a moment.”</p>

				<p>And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.</p>

				<p>“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.</p>

				<p>“Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He arranges the business just as
					he
					pleases.”</p>

				<p>“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least pleasure in the great power of
					choice. I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr.
					Darcy.”
				</p>

				<p>“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam. “But so we all do. It is only
					that
					he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I
					speak
					feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.”</p>

				<p>“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either. Now seriously, what have
					you
					ever known of self-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going
					wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”</p>

				<p>“These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that
					nature. But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry
					where they like.”</p>

				<p>“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do.”</p>

				<p>“Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in my rank of life who can
					afford to
					marry without some attention to money.”</p>

				<p>“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself,
					said
					in a lively tone, “And pray, what is the usual price of an earl’s younger son? Unless the elder
					brother
					is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”</p>

				<p>He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence which might make
					him
					fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said:</p>

				<p>“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his
					disposal.
					I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister
					does
					as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.”</p>

				<p>“No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must divide with me. I am joined with
					him
					in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”</p>

				<p>“Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your charge give you much trouble?
					Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy
					spirit, she may like to have her own way.”</p>

				<p>As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner in which he immediately asked
					her
					why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow
					or
					other got pretty near the truth. She directly replied:</p>

				<p>“You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most
					tractable creatures in the world. She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance,
					Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.”</p>

				<p>“I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--he is a great friend of
					Darcy’s.”
				</p>

				<p>“Oh! yes,” said Elizabeth drily; “Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious
					deal of care of him.”</p>

				<p>“Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants
					care.
					From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much
					indebted
					to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person
					meant.
					It was all conjecture.”</p>

				<p>“What is it you mean?”</p>

				<p>“It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get
					round
					to the lady’s family, it would be an unpleasant thing.”</p>

				<p>“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”</p>

				<p>“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley. What he told me was merely
					this: that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a
					most
					imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it
					to be
					Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing
					them to have been together the whole of last summer.”</p>

				<p>“Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?”</p>

				<p>“I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady.”</p>

				<p>“And what arts did he use to separate them?”</p>

				<p>“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He only told me what I have now
					told
					you.”</p>
